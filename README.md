##### When to do this:

When you want to play windows 10 video games from your arch box because:
1. wangblows and you have access to a windows 10 iso 

2. you don't want to read mountains of text because you just want to play gaems. 

##### Required downloads:

1. a Windows 10 installation iso

## PCI passthrough via OVMF (GPU)

### Initialization

1. Make sure that you have already enabled IOMMU via AMD-Vi or Intel Vt-d in your motherboard's BIOS 
HIT F10 or del or whatever the key is for your motherboard during bios initialization at beginning of startup, enable either VT-d if you have an Intel CPU or AMD-vi if you have an AMD CPU

2. edit `/etc/default/grub` and add [amd|intel]_iommu=on to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT

`$ sudo nvim /etc/default/grub`

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet [amd|intel]_iommu=on"
```

3. re-configure your grub:

`$ sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`


4. reboot


`$ sudo reboot now`


### Isolating the GPU

One of the first things you will want to do is isolate your GPU. The goal of this is to prevent the Linux kernel from loading drivers that would take control of the GPU. Because of this, it is necessary to have two GPUs installed and functional within your system. One will be used for interacting with your Linux host (just like normal), and the other will be passed-through to your Windows guest. In the past, this had to be achieved through using a driver called pci-stub. While it is still possible to do so, it is older and holds no advantage over its successor –vfio-pci.

1. find the device ID of the GPU that will be passed through by running lscpi

`$ lspci -nn`

and look through the given output until you find your desired GPU, they're **bold** in this case:

>09:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GP104 [GeForce GTX 1080] [10de:1b80] (rev a1)
>09:00.1 Audio device [0403]: NVIDIA Corporation GP104 High Definition Audio Controller [10de:10f0] (rev a1)


### Configuring vfio-pci and Regenerating your Initramfs

Next, we need to instruct vfio-pci to target the device in question through the ID numbers gathered above.

1. edit `/etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conffile` and adding the following line with **your ids from the last step above**:

```
options vfio-pci ids=10de:1b80,10de:10f0
```

Next, we will need to ensure that vfio-pci is loaded before other graphics drivers. 

2. edit `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`. At the very top of your file you should see a section titled MODULES. Towards the bottom of this section you should see the uncommented line: MODULES= . Add the in the following order before any other drivers (nouveau, radeon, nvidia, etc) which may be listed: vfio vfio_iommu_type1 vfio_pci vfio_virqfd. The line should look like the following:

```
MODULES="vfio vfio_iommu_type1 vfio_pci vfio_virqfd nouveau"
```

In the same file, also add modconf to the HOOKS line:

```
HOOKS="modconf"
```

3. rebuild initramfs.

`mkinitcpio -g /boot/linux-custom.img`

4. reboot
`$ sudo reboot now`

### Checking whether it worked

1. check pci devices:

`$ lspci -nnk`

Find your GPU and ensure that under “Kernel driver in use:” vfio-pci is displayed:


```
1:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GM204 [GeForce GTX 980] [10de:13c0] (rev a1)
	Subsystem: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd. [MSI] GM204 [GeForce GTX 980] [1462:3177]
	Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci
	Kernel modules: nouveau
01:00.1 Audio device [0403]: NVIDIA Corporation GM204 High Definition Audio Controller [10de:0fbb] (rev a1)
	Subsystem: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd. [MSI] GM204 High Definition Audio Controller [1462:3177]
	Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci
	Kernel modules: snd_hda_intel
```

### Configuring OVMF and Running libvirt

1. download libvirt, virt-manager, ovmf, and qemu (these are all available in the AUR). OVMF is an open-source UEFI firmware designed for KVM and QEMU virtual machines. ovmf may be omitted if your hardware does not support it, or if you would prefer to use SeaBIOS. However, configuring it is very simple and typically worth the effort.

`sudo pacman -S libvirt virt-manager ovmf qemu`

2. edit `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` and add the path to your OVMF firmware image:

```
nvram = ["/usr/share/ovmf/ovmf_code_x64.bin:/usr/share/ovmf/ovmf_vars_x64.bin"]
```

3. Fix EFI not showing up in virt-manager dropdown (libvirt 5.8+ bug)

`sudo rm /usr/share/qemu/firmware/*edk*`

4. Install ebtables and dnsmasq for virtual networks support

`sudo pacman -S ebtables dnsmasq`

4. start and enable both libvirtd and its logger, virtlogd.socket in systemd if you use a different init system, substitute it's commands in for systmectl start

```
$ sudo systemctl start libvirtd.service 
$ sudo systemctl start virtlogd.socket
$ sudo systemctl enable libvirtd.service
$ sudo systemctl enable virtlogd.socket
```

With libvirt running, and your GPU bound, you are now prepared to open up virt-manager and begin configuring your virtual machine.

### virt-manager, a GUI for managing virtual machines

#### setting up virt-manager

**virt-manager** has a fairly comprehensive and intuitive GUI, so you should have little trouble getting your Windows guest up and running. 

1. download virt-manager

`$ sudo pacman -S virt-manager`

2. add yourself to the libvirt group (replace vanities with your username)

`$ sudo usermod -a -G libvirt vanities`

3. launch virt-manager

`$ virt-manager &`

4. when the VM creation wizard asks you to name your VM (final step before clicking "Finish"), check the "Customize before install" checkbox.

5. in the "Overview" section, set your firmware to "UEFI". If the option is grayed out, make sure that you have correctly specified the location of your firmware in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf and restart libvirtd.service by running  `sudo systemctl restart libvirtd`

![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/uefi.png)

6. in the "CPUs" section, change your CPU model to "**host-passthrough**". If it is not in the list, you will have to type it by hand. This will ensure that your CPU is detected properly, since it causes libvirt to expose your CPU capabilities exactly as they are instead of only those it recognizes (which is the preferred default behavior to make CPU behavior easier to reproduce). Without it, some applications may complain about your CPU being of an unknown model.
![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/cpu.png)


7. go into "Add Hardware" and add a Controller for **SCSI** drives of the "VirtIO SCSI" model.
![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/virtioscsi.png)


8. then change the default IDE disk for a **SCSI** disk, which will bind to said controller.
![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/scsi.png)


a. windows VMs will not recognize those drives by default, so you need to download the ISO containing the drivers from [here](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/archive-virtio/virtio-win-0.1.160-1/virtio-win-0.1.160.iso) and add an **SATA** CD-ROM storage device linking to said ISO, otherwise you will not be able to get Windows to recognize it during the installation process.

9. make sure there is another **SATA** CD-ROM device that is handling your windows10 iso from the top links.
![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/satavirtio.png)

10. setup your GPU, navigate to the “Add Hardware” section and select both the GPU and its sound device that was isolated previously in the **PCI** tab
![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/gpu.png)
![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/gpu-audio.png)

11. lastly, attach your usb keyboard

![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/mouse.png)

12. don't forget to pass some good RAM as well
![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/ram.png)

#### installing windows

1. test to see if it works by pressing the **play** button after configuring your VM and install windows

You may see this screen, just type `exit` and bo to the BIOs screen.
![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/exit.jpg)

From the BIOs screen, select and `enter` the **Boot Manager**
![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/select_boot.jpg)

Lastly, pick one of the DVD-ROM ones from these menus
![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/select_dvd.jpg)

2. from here, you should be able to see windows 10 booting up, we need to load the **virtio-scsi** drivers

When you get to **Windows Setup** click `Custom: Install windows only (advanced)`
![alt text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/advanced_windows.JPG)

You should notice that our SCSI hard drive hasn't been detected yet, click `Load driver`
![alt_text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/load_drivers.jpg)

Select the correct CD-ROM labled `virto-win-XXXXX**`
![alt_text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/select_iso.jpg)

Finally, select the `amd64` architecture
![alt_text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/select_arch.jpg)

3. your **SCSI** hard drive device should be there and you should be able to contiune the windows10 install

## Performance Tuning

Check out my [virth xml file](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/virsh-win10.xml)

### CPU pinnging

#### CPU topology

1. check your cpu topology by running

`lscpu -e`

![alt_text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/lscpu.png)


### editing virsh

edit by running something similar with your desired editor and VM name:

`sudo EDITOR=nvim virsh edit win10`

if this doesn't work, check your VM name:

`sudo virsh list`

![alt_text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/cpupinning.png)

your virsh config file should look something like this if your cpu is like mine, otherwise revert to the arch guide:
[cpu-pinning guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#CPU_pinning)

### enabling hugepages
1. edit `/etc/defualt/grub`

`$ sudo nvim /etc/default/grub`

2. add `hugepages=2048` to **GRUB_COMMAND_LINE_DEFAULT**

your final grub should look like this:

![alt_text](https://github.com/vanities/GPU-Passthrough-Arch-Linux-to-Windows10/blob/master/pics/grub.png)

3. re-configure your grub:

`$ sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

4. reboot and test it out
